"But what if it was... faster?" This single sentence somehow accurately sums up the entirety of my research direction. I focused on this idea throughout my work across various fields including binary analysis, networking and operating systems, though these projects have also helped me realize that “faster” must also include "reliable" and "secure." Over the course of my research career, I have had the privilege to find new ways to build "faster" software systems across both government and academic research labs.

I started my research career as a first-year undergrad in a cybersecurity lab, where I was able to collaborate with PhD students on projects with topics ranging from network security to binary analysis and symbolic execution. These projects have resulted in two publications submitted to NDSS and USENIX Security.

This work then led me to a Department of Energy lab, where I built a line-rate packet capture system on commodity hardware to support 100Gbps network cards. This enabled high-speed packet capture for network testbeds without the need for expensive hardware. This was my first independent research project, and I was able to undertake every part of the research project lifecycle. My research there also provided me with a strong understanding of computer systems at the OS level and the many limits modern computers still face.

I then joined a project on simulation and verification for the Mars 2020 project, where I built tools that ensured the integrity of the mission, centered around the rover’s flight software. One of these tools was a fuzzer which found multiple fatal bugs within the flight software of the Mars 2020 rover.

Through my work on Mars 2020, I also developed an interest in FPGAs and heterogeneous computing. This interest brought me to an academic networking lab this summer, where I worked on an FPGA-accelerated intrusion detection system. Through this work, I was also able to appreciate the value of FPGAs in this post-Moore era of computing.

Currently, I am working on a DARPA-funded project attempting to extract mathematical expressions from cyber-physical binaries. This project will significantly advance the field of reverse engineering by developing new methods to understand the execution of an unknown binary. I am also building a line-rate FPGA SmartNIC simulation tool for testbeds as part of my senior thesis, which will enhance HDL testing for FPGA developers and testbed users interested in FPGAs.

I hope to continue working in this field by entering a PhD program next Fall, where I can explore the interplay between software and hardware in computing systems. I am especially interested in finding novel ways to build secure, reliable, and performant systems.

After my PhD, I wish to continue finding ways to improve systems as a research scientist in academia or a national lab. The NDSEG Fellowship will enable me to work on my research ideas while also allowing me to find connections within the DoD research directorate that may help point me in new directions for my research in the future.
